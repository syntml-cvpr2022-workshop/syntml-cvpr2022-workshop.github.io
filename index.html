    <p class="w3-justify">Modern machine learning models are data hungry. Collecting and annotating data is hard and expensive. Moreover, there is a need for diverse training data in order to create fair and unbiased models.
            With advances in simulations and generative models, utilizing synthetic data is becoming a viable alternative to training models using real data.
            However, there are still many open problems to realize this goal, such as lack of standard tools, realism gap between synthetic and real data, and need for machine learning algorithms to effectively utilize imperfect synthetic data.
            The goal of this workshop is to bring in researchers, and discuss potential issues, current trends,  and solutions around utilizing synthetic data to develop accurate machine learning solutions.</p>

        <span class="w3-large w3-text-blue">Title</span>: Synthetics with Digital Humans <br>
        <span class="w3-large w3-text-blue">Abstract</span>: Nowadays, collecting the right dataset for machine learning is often more challenging than choosing the model. We address this with photorealistic synthetic training data â€“ labelled images of humans made using computer graphics. With synthetics we can generate clean labels without annotation noise or error, produce labels otherwise impossible to annotate by hand, and easily control variation and diversity in our datasets. I will show you how synthetics underpins our work on understanding humans, including how it enables fast and accurate 3D face reconstruction, in the wild. <br> <br>

        <span class="w3-large w3-text-blue">Title</span>: Make It Real: Applying StyleGAN On Top of Synthetically Generated Data <br>
        <span class="w3-large w3-text-blue">Abstract</span>: Neural generators like StyleGAN can generate photorealistic images in many domains after learning their distribution "bottom-up" from large image datasets. While it is possible to manipulate the generated images in various ways, controlling the generated content is a hard task, as it requires reverse-engineering the latent space of the StyleGAN. <br>
            At Datagen, we create synthetic visual data â€“ images and videos â€“ using a 3D simulator and a graphics pipeline. We have full control over many aspects of the content we generate. When we generate a person, we can choose the desired ethnicity, expression, hair style, lighting conditions, and accessories (i.e glasses, hats).  Although our 3D artists and engineers strive to make the generated faces and scenes as diverse and realistic as possible, there is often a domain gap between the level of diversity and photorealism we can achieve using the "top-down" graphics pipeline and real-world photos.<br>
            To bridge the domain gap, we propose to first produce an initial version of the desired image using the top-down synthetic pipeline, and then invert this image into the latent space of a StyleGAN trained on real images. We show that the inversion maintains the same person identity, but adds photorealism and provides access to new modes of diversity. It enables us to generate synthetic, photorealistic image datasets that can be used to train computer vision models, such as face recognition, while retaining full control over the distribution of the data. <br>
